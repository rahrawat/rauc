Release 0.4 (released Apr 9, 2018)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Add ``barebox-statename`` key to ``[system]`` section of system.conf in order
  to allow using non-default names for barebox state
* Support atomic bootloader updates for eMMCs.
  The newly introduced slot type ``boot-emmc`` will tell RAUC to handle
  bootloader updates on eMMC by using the ``mmcblkXboot0/-boot1`` partitions
  and the EXT_CSD registers for alternating updates.
* Support writing ``*.vfat`` images to vfat slots
* Add basic support for streaming bundles using casync tool.
  Using the casync tool allows streaming bundle updates chunk-wise over
  http/https/sftp etc.
  By using the source slot as a seed for the reproducible casync chunking
  algorithm, the actual chunks to download get reduced to only those that
  differ from the original system.

  * Add ``rauc convert`` command to convert conventional bundles to casync
    bundle and chunk store
  * Extend update handler to handle ``.caibx`` and ``.caidx`` suffix image types in
    bundle
* Added ``--detailed`` argument to ``rauc status`` to obtain newly added slot
  status information
* Added D-Bus Methods ``GetSlotStatus`` to obtain collected status of all slots
* Extended information stored in slot status files (installed bundle info,
  installation and activation timestamps and counters)
* Optionally use a central status file located in a storage location not
  touched during RAUC updates instead of per-slot files (enabled by setting
  ``statusfile`` key in ``[system]`` section of ``system.conf``).
* Add ``write-slot`` command to write images directly to defined slots (for use
  during development)

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fix documentation out-of-tree builds
* Fixed packaging for dbus wrapper script rauc-service.sh
* Some double-free and error handling fixes

.. rubric:: Testing

* Create uncrustify report during Travis run

.. rubric:: Code

* Unified hash table iteration and variable usage
* Add uncrustify code style configuration checker script to gain consistent
  coding style. Committed changes revealed by initial run.

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Updated and extended D-Bus interface documentation
* Added documentation for newly added features (casync, central slot status,
  etc.)
* Fixed and extended Yocto (meta-rauc) integration documentation
* Add link to IRC/Matrix channel
* Some minor spelling errors fixed

Release 0.3 (released Feb 1, 2018)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Added support for intermediate certificates, improved bundle resigning and
  certificate information for hooks.
  This makes it easier to use a multi-level PKI with separate intermediate
  certificates for development and releases.
  See :ref:`sec-resign` for details.
* Added support for image variants, which allow creating a single bundle which
  supports multiple hardware variants by selecting the matching image from a
  set contained in the bundle.
  See :ref:`sec-variants` for details.
* Added support for redundant booting by using EFI boot entries directly.
  See :ref:`sec-efi` for details.
* Added boot information to ``rauc status``
* Added ``rauc extract`` command to extract bundles
* Support detection of the booted slot by using the ``UUID=`` and ``PARTUUID=``
  kernel options.
* Improved the status and error output
* Improved internal error cause propagation

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Fixed boot slot detection for ``root=<symlink>`` boot parameters (such as
  ``root=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:17.0-ata-1-part1``)
* Removed redundant image checksum verification during installation.

.. rubric:: Testing

* Improve robustness and test coverage
* Use gcc-7 for testing

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Added documentation for

  - intermediate certificates
  - re-signing bundles
  - image variants
  - UEFI support

* Minor fixes and clarifications

Release 0.2 (released Nov 7, 2017)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* Added ``--override-boot-slot`` argument to force booted slot
* Display installation progress and error cause in CLI
* Allow installing uncompressed tar balls
* Error reporting for network handling and fail on HTTP errors
* Added ``--keyring`` command line argument
* Added ``activate-installed`` key and handling for ``system.conf`` that allows
  installing updates without immediately switching boot partitions.
* Extended ``rauc status mark-{good,bad}`` with an optional slot identifier
  argument
* Added subcommand ``rauc status mark-active`` to explicitly activate slots
* New D-Bus method ``mark`` introduced that allows slot activation via D-Bus
* Added ``tar`` archive update handler for ``vfat`` slots
* Introduced ``rauc resign`` command that allows to exchange RAUC signature
  without modifying bundle content
* Display signature verification trust chain in output of ``rauc info``.
  Also generate and display SPKI hash for each certificate
* Added ``--dump-cert`` argument to ``rauc info`` to allow displaying signer
  certificate info

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Added docs/, CHANGES and README to tarball
* Added and reworked a bunch of documentation chapters
* Help text for ``rauc bundle`` fixed
* Added short summary for command help

.. rubric:: Bug fixes

* Include config.h on top of each file to fix largefile support and more
* Let CLI properly fail on excess arguments provided
* Do not disable bundle checking for ``rauc info --no-verify``
* Properly clean up mount points after failures
* Abort on inconsistent slot parent configuration
* Misc memory leak fixes
* Fixes in error handling and debug printout
* Some code cleanups

.. rubric:: Testing

* Add tests for installation via D-Bus
* Let Travis build documentation with treating warnings as errors
* Allow skipping sharness tests requiring service enabled
* Explicitly install dbus-x11 package to fix Travis builds
* Fix coveralls builds by using ``--upgrade`` during
  ``pip install cpp-coveralls``
* Use gcc-6 for testing
